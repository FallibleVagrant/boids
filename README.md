### boids-imgui ###

This is toy project following The Coding Train's misadventures in Processing -- specifically the [boids example](https://thecodingtrain.com/challenges/124-flocking-simulation/) -- but here it is written in C++.

Uses [imgui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) and [implot](https://github.com/epezent/implot).

Make sure you have SDL2 development files installed, as this uses the flavor of imgui that uses it as a backend.
